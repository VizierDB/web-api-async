"""Interface for workflow controller that is passed to the execution backend to
signal state changes in workflow execution. The workflow module whoses state
changes is identified by the unique task identifier. The workflow engine, i.e.,
the project handle, is responsible for keeping track of the task identifier and
their mapping to workflow modules.
